# Deep Learning-Based Accident Detection and Alerting System

## Introduction
Accident detection in surveillance systems is essential for ensuring safety in various contexts, such as roads, highways, parking lots, and industrial areas. Traditional CCTV-based monitoring can face challenges due to low visibility, glare, or obstructions. This project proposes a deep learning-based system for accident detection in surveillance scenarios, addressing these limitations and providing real-time alerts.

## Project Overview
The project uses deep learning techniques to detect accidents from CCTV or surveillance footage. It employs the ResNet50 architecture, a robust convolutional neural network, to classify images into accident and non-accident categories. The following key elements define the project:

- **Deep Learning Approach**: ResNet50, a well-established convolutional neural network, serves as the core algorithm for accident detection. This deep learning-based approach offers significant accuracy improvements over traditional methods.
- **Dataset**: A diverse dataset comprising various scenarios, weather conditions, and types of accidents is used for training and evaluation. This comprehensive dataset ensures the model's robustness.
- **Image Pre-Processing**: Techniques such as noise reduction, image enhancement, and contrast adjustment are applied to improve image quality, contributing to more accurate feature extraction.
- **Data Augmentation**: Methods like rotation, scaling, flipping, and random cropping are employed to increase dataset diversity and improve the model's generalization capabilities.

## Modules
The project consists of several modules:

- **Data Collection**: Gathers surveillance footage and processes it into a suitable format for training and testing.
- **Model Training**: Trains the ResNet50-based model on the dataset and fine-tunes it for optimal accuracy.
- **Image Processing**: Handles pre-processing and data augmentation to improve model performance.
- **Accident Detection**: Uses the trained model to classify surveillance footage in real-time.
- **Alerting System**: Triggers alerts when an accident is detected, allowing for immediate response.

## Methodology and Evaluation
The model is trained on the dataset and fine-tuned to distinguish between accident and non-accident images. Its performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Extensive experiments with real-world surveillance data are conducted to evaluate the system's effectiveness in detecting different types of accidents under varying conditions.

## Requirements
To set up and run the project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your choice of deep learning framework)
- NumPy and OpenCV for image processing
- Scikit-learn for evaluation metrics
- Additional libraries for visualization and alerting (like Matplotlib, Flask, or similar)

## Installation and Setup
To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Set up any necessary configurations (like camera or video input sources).

## Usage
After setting up the project, you can run the system as follows:

1. Start the image processing module to load and pre-process surveillance footage.
2. Launch the model training module to train or fine-tune the ResNet50-based classifier.
3. Initiate the accident detection module to start real-time classification.
4. Configure the alerting system to receive notifications when accidents are detected.
